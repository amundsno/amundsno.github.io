# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Ideas

- Make the running/paused timer more distinct
    - Opt 1: Have a brighter color rotate around the border
    - Opt 2: Dampen the colors of a paused timer? Reduce opacity?
    - Opt 3: Highlight the countdown itself somehow when paused  

- Do not scroll to input even though it is focused and ready to type. This is annoying when deleting timers, because the screen will jump down to the input every time

- Restart button that shows when the timer has completed

- Add a top row of functions:
- Mute/unmute all timers (can just be plain text as well - slightly grayed out and shows only after one has been added)
- Delete all 


Restarte timers

Lagre timers? Lagre presets? Quick start?

- Seems to be autofocusing input when I pause and play - really annoying, must fix

- Wait with displaying the buzz animation until the page is in focus (in view) in case a timer completed while the tab was not open. It will make it easier to see which timer completed.

- Set a maximum number of hours to not break the card design?
